## **üöÄ Quick Start**

### **üß∞ Environment Requirements**

| Tool           | Version Requirement  |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Android Studio | 4.0+                 |
| Android SDK    | API 21+              |
| JDK            | Recommended: 8 or 11 |

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** The current Gradle version **does not support JDK 17 or higher**.

If you have JDK 17, 21, 23, or later installed, please switch to JDK 8 or 11 before building the project.

> **How to set JDK 11:**
>
> In Android Studio, go to `Settings` (
> or `Preferences`) ‚Üí `Build, Execution, Deployment` ‚Üí `Build Tools` ‚Üí `Gradle` ‚Üí `Gradle JDK`, and
> select 11. (If JDK 11 is not available, please upgrade Android Studio.)

### **IDE**

* Android Studio

### **üì¶ Build and Run**

The current player demo project has undergone structural improvements to support both all-in-one and standalone compilation, enhancing development efficiency.

1. **Independent Compilation (Recommended)**

   * ou need to copy the basic module AndroidThirdParty from the AlivcAIODemo project to the current directory.
   * Open and run the project with Android Studio using the current directory as the target folder to achieve standalone compilation of the player module.

2. **Integrated Compilation**

   * The current project is embedded within the AlivcAIODemo project.
   * You can directly open and run AlivcAIODemo with Android Studio to achieve multi-module compilation.

3. **Environment Configuration**
   * Open Android Studio, go to Settings (or Preferences) ‚Üí Build, Execution, Deployment ‚Üí Build Tools ‚Üí Gradle ‚Üí Gradle JDK, select 11 (if 11 is not available, please upgrade Android Studio).

4. **Sync the Project**
   * Android Studio will automatically prompt to sync Gradle.
   * Click `Sync Now` and wait for the synchronization to complete.

5. **Connect Device and Run**
   * Connect an **Android physical** device via USB and ensure that Developer Mode and USB Debugging permissions are enabled.
   * Click the `Run` button (green triangle) on the toolbar.
   * Select the target device and wait for the application to install and run.

### **üß™ Verification Results**

After the application starts, it will enter the main functionality menu page. 
Click any functionality item to jump to the corresponding playback demonstration page.

### **Compilation Configuration**

1. If you are using**All-in-one Compilation**, the underlying SDK utilizes the Audio-Video Terminal SDK (AliVCSDK).
2. If you are using**Standalone Compilation**, you can configure the underlying SDK to use either the player SDK (AliyunPlayer) or the Audio-Video Terminal SDK.
   1. The `allInOne` compilation configuration in the `gradle.properties` file, determines the SDK type used.
   2. true, uses the Audio-Video Terminal SDK; false, uses the player SDK.

## **SDK Integration**

* [SDK download](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/vod/developer-reference/sdk-download)
* [Quick integration](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/vod/developer-reference/quick-integration-1)

**Note: If you integrate both the live streaming push SDK and the player SDK, there will be conflict issues. You can use the [Apsara Video SDK](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/apsara-video-sdk/download-sdks) to avoid conflicts.**
